This is a bakery website I built for a friend of friend's. My challeng is to think about interesting elements of the website and the structure of it. I kept adding things by observing other good sites so that I could get inspiration. I also learnt that to keep my website as simple as possibile. I prefer minimalism per se, it would be ideal if the product gets all attention, not the design itself. Finally, keep my coding tidy by using debug tool is what I have learnt. CSS Framework like Bootstrap certainly is a great tool!
